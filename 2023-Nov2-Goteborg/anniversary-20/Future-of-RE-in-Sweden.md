# The future of RE research in Sweden

## History 1993-2017
  * Pre-history -1980: Software Engineering becomes a discipline of its own
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_software_engineering

  * 1990-1999: Requirements Engineering becomes a research discipline of its own
    * Focus on the **specification problem**
    * Some founding "parents": Anthony Finkelstein, Kevin Ryan, Alan Davis,Alistair Sutcliffe, Nancy Mead, Daniel Berry, Roel Wieringa, Anthony Finkelstein, Donald Gause, John Mylopoulos, Michael Jackson, Axel van Lamsweerde, Martin Glinz
    * 1993: First international RE conference in San Diego
      * http://requirements-engineering.org/
    * 1993 Kristian Sandahl in Linköping and Claes Wohlin in Lund recruits the first doctoral candidates in Requirements Engineering: Björn Regnell, Joachim Karlsson
    * 1995: My first visited RE conference (York, UK)
    * 1998: Dissertation: Karlsson, Joachim "A Systematic approach for prioritizing software *requirements*.", Supervisor Kristian Sandahl, Linköping Univ.
    * 1999: Dissertation: Regnell, Björn "*Requirements* Engineering with Use Cases - a Basis for Software Development"

  * 2000-2009:
    * RE becomes broader: **elicitation**, **stakeholders**, **decision process**
    * RE becomes interdisciplinary: **user experiece**, **testing**, **business**
    * Swedish expansion in RE: (in 2006 one of the bigger nations at RE'06)

      * Lund:
        * 2005: Dissertation: Johan Natt och Dag, "Managing Natural Language *Requirements* in Large Scale Software Development",
        * 2006: Dissertation: Lena Karlsson, "*Requirements* Prioritisation and Retrospective Analysis for Release Planning Process Improvement",
        * 2011: Dissertation: Richard Berntsson Svensson, "Supporting Release Planning of Quality *Requirements*: The Quality Performance Model"

      * BTH:
        * 2006: Dissertation: Tony Gorschek, "*Requirements* Engineering Supporting Technical Product Management" (main advisor).
        * 2007: Dissertation: Patrik Berander, "Evolving Prioritization for Software Product Management"

      * Linköping:
        * 2001: Dissertation: Pär Carlshamre, "A usability perspective on *requirements* engineering – From methodology to product development."
        * 2009: Dissertation: Andreas Borg, "Processes and Models for Capacity *Requirements* in Telecommunication Systems"

  * 2010-:
    * Specification-focused RE is challenged by Agile
    * Closed source is challenged by open source
    * Decentralized teams, hierarchies are broken down
      => coders become requirements engineers
    * System architectures are evolving:
      => Apps, Cloud, Compute, IoT "the edge"

    * Lund:
      * 2012: Dissertation: Krzysztof Wnuk, "Visualizing, Analyzing and Managing the Scope of Software Releases in Large-Scale *Requirements* Engineering"
      * 2013: Dissertation: Elizabeth Bjarnason, "Integrated *Requirements* Engineering - Understanding and Bridging Gaps within Software Development"

    * BTH:
      * 2011: Dissertation: Mahvish Khurum "Decision Support for Product Management of Software Intensive Products"

      * 2015: Dissertation: Michael Unterkalmsteiner "Coordinating *Requirements* Engineering and Software Testing"

    * Chalmers+GU:
      * ...

    * KTH+SU:
      * 2016: Dissertation: Eric-Oluf Svee "Consumer Preferences to Promote Values Awareness in Information Systems Development"

## Future

  * 2020: RE is more relevant than ever, but is RE research relevant?

    * AI-technologies enter software engineering:
      * the machine will help us to
        * better **manage ultra-high complexity** and
        * faster **making the right _requirements_ decisions**
      * Knowledge representation
    * Big user data for elicitation and selection, live experiments on users
    * Social control, social manipulation, social networks
    * Ethical requirements engineering
      * Standardisation, IREB etc.
      * Monetization of publicly funded knowledge
    * Open requirements engineering
    * Creativity and Innovation in RE

  * **Weaknesses and risks** of Swedish RE research:
    * Not reaching critical mass
    * Operating in the context of a defunct research funding system
    * Getting disconnected from emerging coding practices
      * Decentralized decision-making, coders are the main requirements engineers
      * Failing to connect management with technology
      * Failing to connect to a modern tool chain

  * **Strengths and opportunities** of Swedish RE research:
    * Excellent track record
    * Strong software industry
    * Tradition of collaboration between academia and industry
    * Empirical: from quantitative to mixed mode
      * Design science cycle rather than descriptive first then solution

  * What should I do as a *supervisor* to stay _relevant_?
    * Be prepared for both...
      * qualitative+ quantitative
      * empirical + analytical

    * Interdisciplinary: find a peer in another discipline
      * Multidisciplinary:
        * RE+Architecture, RE+Test, RE+Business, RE+Management, RE+Psychology

  * What should I do as a *doctoral candidate* to stay _relevant_?
    * **Connect** with the RE community
      * SiREN
      * REFSQ
      * RE
      * REJ

    * **Connect** with the SE and/or IS community (ICSE, CAiSE, TSE, EMSE, ...)

    * **Combine**
      * empirically founded _descriptive_ research => theory building
      * innovative solutions: _prescriptive_ research => methods, tools, processes, languages, ...
      * _evaulation_ of innovative solutions in real life contexts

    * **Extend your competence**
      * Getting your fingers dirty in industrial practice
        * Do REAL requirements engineering (interaction, intention, decision-making)
        * Explicitly formulate problems that real stakeholders want solutions to
        * Explicitly formulate questions that real stakeholders want answers to
      * Understanding RE literature
        * Terminology issues
      * Develop your own open source software
        * Understand the implications of the tool chain that enables decentralization:
          * Distrubuted version control
          * Community development
          * Continuous deployment
      * Thinking out of the current industrial box of development practice
        * Create hypotheses regarding future development practice
